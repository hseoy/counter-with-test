# counter-with-test

Implement a simple counter app, and a write test code

I will implement and test the functions below.

- [x] the initial value is 0.
- [x] click the plus button to increment the count by 1.
- [x] click the minus button to decrement the count by 1.
- [x] click the reset button to set the count to 0.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hseoy/counter-with-test.git
$ cd counter-with-test
$ yarn install
$ yarn start # start live-server
$ yarn cypress:open # to test with cypress
```
